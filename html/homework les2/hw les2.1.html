            From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
        </p>
        <p class="retreat"><i>This article is about the character Peter Pan. For the original play and novel about the
            character, see</i> <a href="">Peter and Wendy</a>. <i>For other uses, see</i> <a href="">Peter Pan
            (disambiguation)</a>.</p>
        <p>Peter Pan is a fictional character created by <a href="">Scottish novelist </a>and playwright <a
                href="">J. M. Barrie</a>. A free-spirited
            and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having
            adventures on the mythical island of <a href="">Neverland</a> as the leader of the <a href="">Lost Boys</a>,
            interacting with <a href="">fairies,
                pirates, mermaids, Native Americans</a>, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside
            Neverland.</p>
        <p>Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and <a href="">escapism</a>. In addition
            to two
            distinct
            works by Barrie, <a href=""><i>The Little White Bird</i></a> (1902, with chapters 13–18 published in <a
                    href=""><i>Peter Pan
                in Kensington
                Gardens</i></a> in 1906), and the<a href=""> West End stage</a> play <a href=""><i>Peter Pan; or, the
                Boy Who
                Wouldn't Grow Up</i></a> (1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel<a
                    href=""><i> Peter and Wendy</i></a>),
            the character has been featured in a variety of media and
            merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include several films, television series
            and many other works.</p>
        <p>Barrie commissioned a <a href="">statue of Peter Pan</a> by the sculptor <a href=""> George Frampton</a>,
            which was
            erected overnight in
            <a href=""> Kensington Gardens</a> on 30 April 1912 as a surprise to the children of Londona <a
                    href=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> Six
            other statues have been
            cast from the original mould and displayed around the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a series of UK
            postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail on the centenary of Barrie's creation of the character.<a
                    href=""><sup>[2]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <h2>Origin <sub>[<a href="">edit</a>]</sub></h2>
        <p>
            Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's <a href=""><i>The Little White Bird</i></a> (1902), a
            novel for adults. In
            chapters 13–18, titled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from
            his nursery to<a href=""> Kensington Gardens</a> in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly.
            He is described
            as "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the
            centre of his <a href="">stage play</a> titled <a href=""><i>Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</i></a>,
            which premiered on 27 December
            1904 at the <a href="">Duke of York's Theatre</a> in London.<a href=""><sup>[3] </sup></a>Following the
            success of the 1904 play, Barrie's
            publishers, <a href="">Hodder and Stoughton</a>, extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little White Bird
            and published
            them in 1906 under the title <a href=""><i>Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</i></a>, with the addition of
            illustrations by <a href="">Arthur
            Rackham.<sup>[4]</sup></a> Barrie later adapted and expanded the 1904 play's storyline as a <a
                href="">novel</a>, which
            was published in 1911 as <a href=""><i>Peter and Wendy</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an
            ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a
            boy.<a href=""><sup>[5]</sup></a>

        </p>
        <h2>Physical appearance <sub>[<a href="">edit</a>]</sub></h2>
        <p>
            Barrie never described Peter's appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of the
            reader and the interpretation of anyone adapting the character. In the play, Peter's outfit is made of
            autumn leaves and cobwebs <a href=""><sup>[6]</sup></a> His name and playing the <a href="">flute or
            pipes</a> suggest the Greek god and mythological character <a href="">Pan</a>. Barrie mentions in Peter and
            Wendy that Peter Pan still had all his "first
            teeth".<a href=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> He
            describes him as a "lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees".<a href=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> In The
            Little White Bird (1902) and Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens (1906), he is seven days old.<a href=""><sup>[8]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditionally, the character has been <a href="">played on stage by a petite adult woman</a>.<a
                href=""><sup>[9] </sup></a>In the
            original
            productions in the UK, Peter Pan's costume was a reddish tunic and dark green tights, such as that worn by
            <a href="">Nina Boucicault</a> in 1904. This costume is exhibited at <a href="">Barrie's Birthplace</a>.
            <a href=""><sup>[10]</sup></a> The
            similar costume worn by
            <a href="">Pauline Chase</a> (who played the role from 1906 to 1913) is displayed in the <a href="">Museum of
            London</a>. Early editions
            of adaptations of the story also depict a red costume<a href=""><sup>[11][12]</sup></a>but a green costume
            (whether or not made of
            leaves) becomes more usual from the 1920s,<a href=""><sup>[13]</sup></a> and more so later after the release
            of
            Disney's animated
            movie.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tights
            apparently made of cloth, and a cap with a red feather in it. He has pointed <a href="">elf</a>-like ears, brown eyes, and
            reddish hair.
        </p>
        <p>
            In <a href=""><i>Hook</i></a> (1991), the character is played as an adult by <a href="">Robin Williams</a>, with blue
            eyes and dark brown hair;
            in flashbacks to him in his youth, his hair is light brown. His ears appear pointed only when he is Peter
            Pan, not as Peter Banning. His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus the cap).
        </p>
        <p>
            In the live-action <a href="">2003 <i>Peter Pan</i> film</a>, he is portrayed by <a href="">Jeremy Sumpter</a>, with blond
            hair, green eyes,
            bare
            feet and a costume made of leaves and vines.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the prequel to the main story <a href="">2015 <i>Pan</i> film</a>, he is portrayed by <a href="">Levi Miller</a>, a
            young
            boy who was left as
            a baby by the orphanage until he gets captured by Blackbeard's pirates and taken to Neverland. Here he wears
            just simple clothes.
