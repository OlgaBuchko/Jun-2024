    <p>I try to set things in motion in my work and private life. I look at situations with a holistic approach, I
        perceive connections and overlaps.</p>
    <p>A long journey of personal knowledge of mindsets brought me to coaching.</p>
    <p>
        It all started with my belief in three good questions that change the course of a situation, regardless of
        whether it is a meeting, an interview or a "pub" topic.
    </p>
    <p>
        He experienced coaching and mentoring firsthand. I felt the power of well-asked questions that change the
        situation, the plot, give meaning and open up previously unimagined <br/>
        I felt the need to think deeply about the topic and find the much needed inner answer and related motivation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe that the key to personal growth is realizing one's own strength and potential. For me, the motto "Esto
        Magnus" means the constant search and achievement of personal mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coaching has become my fulfillment, I have inner joy in helping others change their way of thinking and direction.
    </p>
    <h2>I listen patiently and support your decision.</h2>
